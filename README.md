</div>

## What is Twitcherzz ? ü§î

*Twitcherzz* is a Discord bot made to automate tasks in the *SIO Gaming* server.

This bot is free for everyone and always will be.

## How does it work ? üí°

When the administrator invites *Twitcherzz* on his server, the bot will run some configuration tasks and then send a message to indicate that it's ready on the first channel where it has the necessary permessions.

## Features ‚öôÔ∏è

* **Twitch automation :**
  * Administrator(s) can add Twitch streamers to the bot with the `$config` command.
  * When a streamer goes live, Twitcherzz will ping everyone and give the title + description of the stream.

* **Game Testing:**
  * The *SIO Gaming* often tests games, the bot gives the ability to the users to check the status of the tested games.
  * Administrator(s) have access to all CRUD (*Create Read Update Delete*) operations on the tested games.
  * Users can list the tested games: `$games`.
  * Users can get the status of a specific game: `$game nameOfTheGame`.

This list is ever-growing thanks to active development and our exceptional contributors. See a full list of documented commands by using the `$help` command.
